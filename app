	Essentially this app contains two parts, a social aspect and money saving aspect. We believe these two features are very marketable towards college students. 

Features 

Gatherings Location Upload 
Opt to be on a location service where people can post gatherings . Essentially, the user opens the “gatherings” tab and can see events people are posting on a map. 
> Events can be study sessions, parties, sports games, general hangouts, campus events, bar crawls, club meetings, and more. 
> Users can post pictures, videos, and captions about their event. These will be under a “more info” tab.
			> Events can be tagged with an age discretion
			> Events will appear larger or smaller based on the number of RSVPs
>The user can RSVP to an event and see the other RSVP members.
>Parties will have their own flair, since this app is targeted towards college students.

Deal Finder 
>Daily database that a user can search for specific stores, brands, types of product, etc.
>Uses AI to search for deals at local grocery chains based on their websites.
>This will also include a tab where people can upload pictures of deals onto a social media like feed. 
>Since this app is targeted to college students, alcohol will be highly promoted, if the user’s age is confirmed to be 21.
  Student Discount Sub-Tab
  > Partner with brands and services to offer special college student discounts.
  > An AI will also use the user’s search to find college-specific deals based on a search. 
  > Students can post verified student discounts onto a social media feed. 
  >This would be the app’s main revenue stream, from promoting certain brands/stores/products over others.
Security 
>Every user must enter a valid school email with confirmation.
>Users can report gatherings for misconduct or for safety reasons. 
>Users under 21 are unable to see age discerned events.
>Users can be reviewed based on their events and deals postings to decrease the amount of sketchy users
